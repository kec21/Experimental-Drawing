# Art Writing as a Practice

General Statement as the work stands:  

I find the nature of my work changing as I age, and without any direct intention, that idea has been seeping its way into my art. When I tell people that I am starting to make work about aging, anyone over the age of 50 proceeds to launch into a prerehersed and much repeated speech about how young I am, how I'm not old and how I am thinking about these things much too early in my life. My question is, when do I earn the much protected and lauded accolades that will allow me to speak frankly and honestly about the processs of aging? At what arbitrary point do I become old? Is this temporal point of passage one that is dependable and permanent or is it also subject to the same ebb and flow of change? Isn't aging a slow and constant process that begins at birth? Shouldn't we be talking about this more?

I think that half of the problem of aging and how it is viewed in this society is the very fact that, as a subject, it is is just as invislbe and silcenced as the subject of disability. If we were to talk frankly with one another, we would find the commonality in our experiences and begin to peice together some kind of set of expectations that could passed on to the next generation. The fact that I am alone in my journey to old age is almost unforgiveable. And it's odd because I'm not really alone - there are elder members all around me. The problem is how unwilling they are to talk about aging. It's either embarassment, so you get a bunch of jokes, or anxiety, so they tell you how grateful you should be that you're still young (i.e. younger than them). Etiher way, you don't et any real advice or anything close to a set of realistic expectations. Extremely advanced age is even worse. It's a terrifying concept to most people because the elderly no longer live with us. We would have access to these older members of society to recieve their wisdom if they were not locked away in retirement homes and villages. We shy away from age. We cover it with wrinkle creams, vitamins, supplements, medications, exercise routines, and extreme diets. We cannot accept the fact that one day we will die. And we definately don't talk about it.
