## It's Only a Fleshwound  

Is an apology just another platitude?  

## Video Animation  

I have taken a large bag of band aids collected from at home medical injection kits (they always sent a ridiculous amount) and have stamped them with the words IM SORRY. Josh and I will be setting up a camera on a tripod and put me in front of it. Meanwhile Josh slowly covers my face in band-aid apologies, until I can't see or speak, and finally until you can't see me anymore.
