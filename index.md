# Experimental Drawing

This is where I will be keeping all my documentation for the semester, but also where I will store my thoughts, observations, and ideas that emerge in connection with drawing and this class. My plan is to do an extensive amount of writing, as well as push myself into using video, augmented reality, and photography more deliberately in my practice.
