# WEEK THREE  

This is mostly going to be me complaining about gatekeeping, so strap in.  

## PROBLEMATIC STATEMENT 1  

"ACCOMODATION IS A PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE ABLEIST WORD"  

Continually changing the labels for everything is distracting from the actual issue, which is how spaces are desgined.

## PROBLEMATIC STATEMENT 2

"UNIVERSAL DESIGN DE-CENTERS DISABLED EXPERIENCE"

This is backwards progress. The very idea of a center implies singularity, the same way that the word priority used to. The idea that you can have multiple centers is bullshit, and this goes back to the idea of rights-as-pie. This concept outlines thinking that sees civil and human rights as some kind of finite resource, to be divided up among the various marginalized identities. This mode of thinking then lends itself to the falacy that there is some kind of order that these rights should be given out, rights-as-queue. This argument is made a thousand different ways, anything from using time spent opressed to quantifying the severity of oppression. These contests of opression olympics are fueled our egotistic need to feel special, to hyper-individualize ourselves as a way to cement and preserve our sense of self. We lament the loss of community, but are terrified to loose ourselves. Tribalism is tearing us apart at every level, but most importantly at the level of human rights. I saw this posted to various stories on Instagram activist pages the other day, and was immediately disgusted. When I first heard about Universal Design, I thought that this was finally the way forward for EVERYONE. Instead of looking at each issue - disability accomodations, ESOL students, neurodivergent learning - the solution was making spaces as usable as possible for everyone. This is an impossible task, of course. You can never anticipate every situation that will come up in classroom or a workspace. However, incepting a space from the beginning with access in mind ensures that flexible thinking reamins a characteristic of that space. The framing of that space as an evolving space instead of a fixed structure is also an important part of fixing institutional problems.
